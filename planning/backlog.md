## What is a User Story :grey_question:

> User Stories are one of the core elements of the Agile methodology. However, they’re often jumbled with software requirements which isn’t true. So what is a User Story?

> User Story is a small (actually, the smallest) piece of work that represents some value to an end user and can be delivered during a sprint.

> The main aim of this element is to put end users in the center of conversation and capture product functionality from their perspective. Thus, developers get a better understanding of what, for whom and why they’re building.
