## What are our project constraints?

Project constraints are limiting factors for our project that can impact quality, delivery, and overall project success.

## The constraints of project

| Type    | Define of Constraints                                                                                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quality | Minimum code quality must be ensured.                                                                              |
| Time    | We have to finish the project in 1 week :runner:                                                                  |
| Cost    | We have no cost during the project :moneybag:                                                                     |
| Scope   | There is no constraints for scope because we are not not expected to submit exactly the same code as Mr. Traversy |
